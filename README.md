# gentiaudio_coding_challenge
This repository contains my submission for the Genti Audio Coding Challenger. The challenge was solved with Java programming language.

To run the programs, I got an online Java compiler at https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler/ 
This was done to eliminate the struggle of getting jdk and setting it up on your local machine.
Steps:
1. Log on to https://www.jdoodle.com/online-java-compiler/
2. Copy the codes to the IDE provided
3. Check "Interactive" to true right above the console. This is to make the console also accept input from users
4. Click "Execute" then check and interact with the program's output in the "Result" section.
5. For the missing value in array problem, kindly manipulate variables "arr" and "n" to get different outputs.

NOTE: The speed of execution could be a bit slower because the compiler is online and could take it some times to generate results. This behaviour is not so on a local machine.
